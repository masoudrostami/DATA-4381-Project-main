# **American Airlines - Bag Check Prediction**

The Goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can accurately predict the number of bags that will be on each flight from American Airlines.

## **Overview**
For the American Airlines Bag check Prediction, the goal it to accurately predict the number of bags that will be on each flight. In doing so airlines can become more efficent. Currently I anticipate to use a mulitple linear regression model in order to predict the number of bags.
Include only the sections that are relevant an appropriate.

## **Summary of Work Done**
### **Data**
* Type: Categorical and Numerical
* Input: Individual flights
* Size: 268000x74
* Instances: 268000

**Preprocessing / Clean up**\
For preprocessing I removed all nulls and duplicates from the data set. 

**Data Visualization**\
Still in process

**Software Setup**\
import numpy as np\
import matplotlib\
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\
from matplotlib import colors\
import pandas as pd\
import seaborn as sns

## How to Reproduce the Results
**Point to where they can download the data**\
this Data can only be accessed through permission from American Airlines

**Describe how to train the model**\
Model is still underway
